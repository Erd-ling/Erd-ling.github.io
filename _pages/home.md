### Welcome!

Welcome/Willkommen/Dobrodošli/どうぞよろしく/Hoş geldiniz! I'm a PhD student in General Linguistics at the Institute of Linguistics (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf). My research areas are Phonetics, Phonology and Psycholinguistics. I recently became interested in Morphology and Computational linguistics as well.

### About me

I investigate the learning mechanisms behind phonetic, phonological and morphophonological learning, and how these mechanisms allow linguistic structure to emerge. I approach language from a discriminative error-driven learning perspective. For my PhD-project, I investigate the learning mechanisms behind phonetic category acquisition (phonetics), sound pattern acquisition (phonology) and form-meaning associations (morphophonology). To answer these questions, I use computational and experimental methods.

By investigating the mechanisms behind language learning, I hope to to better understand why certain linguistic properties appear to be harder to learn than others, as well as to find out what kinds of representations emerge during learning – and whether these representations differ in kind or in degree.
