  headline: "Contributed my voice to the 'Heinrich Heine in your Mother Tongue' project"
  #The project consists of reading recordings of Heinrich Heine's famous poem 'Lorelei' in more than 30 languages. 
  #The recordings were collected to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Heinrich-Heine University. 
  #Although I found out that my Serbo-Croatian got more rusty than I imagined, I enjoyed reading the Serbo-Croatian translation of the poem.
  #Credits go to Aaron Kassat and Pamela Villar Gonz√°lez. [Follow this link to listen to the readings](https://media.hhu.de/group/Heinrich-Heine26230393Bs-poem-26quot3BDie-Lorelei26quot3B-translated/1e53c461bc41b034c19556a2c7670944#media)
